<em>
Lyrical as usual, Apple said about Dark Mode that it’s a “dramatic new look that helps you focus on your work,’’ as well as a “distraction-free environment that’s easy on the eyes — in every way”.
</em>
<br>
<br>

Google was much more pragmatic, saying Dark Theme can “reduce power usage by a significant amount”, “improve visibility for users with low vision and those who are sensitive to bright light” and “make it easier for anyone to use a device in a low-light environment”.
