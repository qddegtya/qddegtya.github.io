<img alt="jpaulm" src="/assets/book/fbp/fbp-author.jpeg" width="160" style="margin-bottom: 8px;" class="align-left" /> Paul was born John Paul Rodker, the son of John Rodker, writer and publisher, and the artist, Barbara Stanger McKenzie-Smith, in London, England. His name was changed to Morrison by deed poll when his mother remarried. He was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, Eton College, and then King's College, Cambridge, where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology. He switched to the expanding computer field, starting to work for IBM UK in 1959, moved to the US in 1963, and then moved to Canada 5 years later and became a Canadian citizen. He retired from IBM in 1992, worked for a major bank for 2 1/2 years, and then as a contractor for 10 more years. He now lives and consults in Unionville, Ontario.

### 其它

博主因近几年在该领域的研究工作，偶然得知 `Flow-based Programming` 编程范式，从而深入了解了下 `J.Paul` 先生的生平，他是 `FBP` 之父，英国人，毕业于剑桥大学，毕业后加入 `IBM` 工作，从此成为计算机领域的先驱者，在应用架构领域深耕超过 `60` 年，`FBP` 生态衍生出了多个著名的开源项目，其中提出的一些思想远早于后来的 `Go` 语言并发原语设计以及分布式计算理论，他一生致力于此，并写下此书，`FBP` 时至今日仍在影响着应用程序架构设计的方方面面，先生为此奉献一生，做出巨大贡献。先生于 `2022` 年安详去世，如今，社区仍然在继承他的遗志，让 `FBP` 的价值被更多的人看到。
